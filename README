The goal of this project is to bring Node.js to the Java world. 
Well, not exactly Node.js, but its asynchronous, "single threaded"
programming model.

The API is trying to Mimic Node's API, but due to the significant 
differences between Java and JavaScript, compromises will have to
be made.

First and foremost, Java does not support first-class functions,
let alone closures. However, it should be easy enough to mimic
them with classes. Yes, the code is more verbose (i.e. harder to
read and understand) but this does not stop us from using the
desired programming model.
